# Introduction to Stream Processing

### Glossary of Key Terms You’ll Learn in this Lesson
* Stream - An unbounded sequence of ordered, immutable data
* Stream Processing - Continual calculations performed on one or more Streams
* Immutable Data - Data that cannot be changed once it has been created
* Event - An immutable fact regarding something that has occurred in our system.
* Batch Processing - Scheduled, periodic analysis of one or more groups of related data.
* Data Store - A generic place that holds data of some kind, like a message queue or data store
* Stream Processing Application - An application which is downstream of one or 
more data streams and performs some kind of calculation on incoming data, 
typically producing one or more output data streams
* Stream Processing Framework - A set of tools, typically bundled as a library,
used to construct a Stream Processing Application
* Real-time - In relation to processing, this implies that a piece of data, or an event,
is processed almost as soon as it is produced. Strict time-based definitions of real-time are
controversial in the industry and vary widely between applications. 
For example, a Computer Vision application may consider real-time to be 1 millisecond or less,
whereas a data engineering team may consider it to be 30 seconds or less.
In this class when the term "real-time" is used, the time-frame we have in mind is seconds.
* Append-only Log - files in which incoming events are written to the end of the file as they are received
* Change Data Capture (CDC) - The process of capturing change events, typically in SQL database systems,
in order to accurately communicate and synchronize changes from primary to replica nodes 
in a clustered system.
* Log-Structured Storage - Systems built on Append-Only Logs, in which system data is stored in log format.
* Merge (Log Files) - When two or more log files are joined together into a single output log file
* Compact (Log Files) - When data from one or more files is deleted, typically based on the age of data
* Source (Kafka) - A term sometimes used to refer to Kafka clients which are producing data into Kafka, 
typically in reference to another data store
* Sink (Kafka) - A term sometimes used to refer to Kafka clients which are extracting data from Kafka, 
typically in reference to another data store
* Topic (Kafka) - A logical construct used to organize and segment datasets within Kafka, similar 
to how SQL databases use tables
* Producer (Kafka) - An application which is sending data to one or more Kafka Topics.
* Consumer (Kafka) - An application which is receiving data from one or more Kafka Topics.
