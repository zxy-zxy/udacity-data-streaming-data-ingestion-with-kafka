### Glossary

* Broker (Kafka) - A single member server of the Kafka cluster
* Cluster (Kafka) - A group of one or more Kafka Brokers working together to satisfy Kafka production and consumption
* Node - A single computing instance. May be physical, as in a server in a datacenter, or virtual, 
as an instance might be in AWS, GCP, or Azure.
* Zookeeper - Used by Kafka Brokers to determine which broker is the leader of a given partition and topic, 
as well as track cluster membership and configuration for Kafka
* Access Control List (ACL) - Permissions associated with an object. 
In Kafka, this typically refers to a userâ€™s permissions with respect to production and consumption, 
and/or the topics themselves.
* JVM - The Java Virtual Machine. Responsible for allowing host computers to execute 
the byte-code compiled against the JVM.
* Data Partition (Kafka) - Kafka topics consist of one or more partitions. 
A partition is a log which provides ordering guarantees for all of the data contained within it. 
Partitions are chosen by hashing key values.
* Data Replication (Kafka) - A mechanism by which data is written to more than 
one broker to ensure that if a single broker is lost, a replicated copy of the data is available.
* In-Sync Replica (ISR) - A broker which is up to date with the leader for a particular broker 
for all of the messages in the current topic. This number may be less than the replication factor for a topic.
* Rebalance - A process in which the current set of consumers changes (addition or removal of consumer). 
When this occurs, assignment of partitions to the various consumers in a consumer group must be changed.
* Data Expiration - A process in which data is removed from a Topic log, determined by data retention 
policies.
* Data Retention - Policies that determine how long data should be kept. Configured by time or size.
* Batch Size - The number of messages that are sent or received from Kafka
* acks - The number of broker acknowledgements that must be received from Kafka before a 
producer continues processing
* Synchronous Production - Producers which send a message and wait for a response before 
performing additional processing
* Asynchronous Production - Producers which send a message and do not wait for a response before 
performing additional processing
* Avro - A binary message serialization format
* Message Serialization - The process of transforming an applications internal data representation to a 
format suitable for interprocess communication over a protocol like TCP or HTTP.
* Message Deserialization - The process of transforming an incoming set of data from a form 
suitable for interprocess communication, into a data representation more suitable for the application receiving the data.
* Retries (Kafka Producer) - The number of times the underlying library will attempt to deliver data 
before moving on
* Consumer Offset - A value indicating the last seen processed of a given consumer, by ID.
* Consumer Group - A collection of one or more consumers, identified by group.id which collaborate to 
consume data from Kafka and share a consumer offset.
* Consumer Group Coordinator - The broker in charge of working with the Consumer Group Leader to 
initiate a rebalance
* Consumer Group Leader - The consumer in charge of working with the Group Coordinator to manage 
the consumer group
* Topic Subscription - Kafka consumers indicate to the Kafka Cluster that they would like to consume 
from one or more topics by specifying one or more topics that they wish to subscribe to.
* Consumer Lag - The difference between the offset of a consumer group and the latest message offset in 
Kafka itself
* CCPA - California Consumer Privacy Act
* GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
